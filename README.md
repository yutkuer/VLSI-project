For METU EE 413 course I designed a custom signal manipulator. This system gets triangular analog wave and 6 bit binary code as input. Analog signal converted to 8 bit digital data with the help of SAR ADC and depending on the 6 bit opcode input ALU manipulates the digitalized signal. At the end by using a DAC manipulated signal is given as output.
